        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          Photography has been my passion for over a decade. Growing up in the stunning landscapes of Scotland,
          I developed a deep appreciation for the natural world and its ever-changing beauty. What started as a
          hobby with a basic camera has evolved into a lifelong dedication to capturing the essence of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work focuses on the raw beauty of Scotland's landscapes, wildlife, and coastal scenes. I believe
          that every moment in nature tells a story, and my goal is to preserve those fleeting moments of wonder
          and share them with the world.

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I specialize in outdoor and nature photography, with a particular focus on the Scottish Highlands,
          coastal landscapes, and wildlife. Each photograph is carefully composed to showcase the unique character
          and atmosphere of the location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's the golden light of dawn breaking over a misty glen, the dramatic cliffs of the Scottish
          coast, or the gentle presence of Highland cattle in their natural habitat, I strive to create images
          that evoke emotion and connection to the natural world.
